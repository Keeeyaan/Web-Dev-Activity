                        <h1>What is <span>Web Development</span>?</h1>
                        <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens
                            behind
                            the
                            scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user
                            experience.
                            <br><br>
                            Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages
                            they
                            use
                            depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are
                            working.
                            <br><br>
                            Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a
                            great
                            career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a
                            traditional university degree to become qualified.

                        <h1>Comparing <span>Front-End</span> and <span>Back-End Development</span></h1>
                        <p>
                            A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and
                            JavaScript.
                            They
                            take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality.
                            <br><br>
                            What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop down menus
                            and
                            the
                            text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to
                            bind
                            and
                            structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programmes are run
                            through
                            a browser.
                            <br><br>
                            The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data
                            is
                            stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists
                            of
                            the
                            server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the
                            data.
                            <br><br>
                            The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the
                            database
                            run smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and
                            provide
                            efficient programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of
                            server-side
                            languages, like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java.
                        </p>
                        <h1>What about <span>Full-Stack Development</span>?</h1>
                        <p>If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a
                            Full-Stack
                            Developer.
                            <br><br>
                            Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web
                            works
                            on all levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate. Naturally
                            working
                            up to this level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to learn.
